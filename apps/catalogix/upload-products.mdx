<Tip> If your Excel file does not include image links, please upload a **.zip** file containing your product images. Make sure the **.zip** is structured correctly — it should have **one main folder**, and inside it, **multiple subfolders**, each named after the **style code** of the product. </Tip>

<Tip>
Use Deep Context Mapping when you need AI-driven suggestions for complex product attributes.
