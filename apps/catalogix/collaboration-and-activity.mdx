# Collaboration and Activity

## Overview

Catalogix includes collaboration tools that help teams split workloads, stay aware of active teammates, and audit store changes. Use the sections below to assign owners, stay in sync, and review activity logs.

## Assign Products

Use the **Assignee** attribute on the PLP to allocate products to teammates. Filter by assignee to review each member's workload individually.

## Online Status

Catalogix displays teammate initials in the upper-right corner of the PLP when they are online. This helps you see who else is working in the store in real time.

## Sync Changes

Large updates, such as product uploads or bulk edits, trigger a **Sync your changes** prompt so everyone refreshes to the latest catalog data.

## Store Activity

Open the clock icon on the PLP to launch the **Store Activity** timeline. Filter by date range or user to audit store-wide updates.

## Automation History

Within the activity panel, the **Automations** tab lists every automation executed on the store along with its status.
