Photogenix gives you two powerful controls — **Regenerate** and **Retouch** — so you can iterate on AI outputs without restarting the entire workflow.

<Expandable title="Regenerate">
To change the model or background in generated images:

1. Click **Regenerate** on your image.  
2. Update your selections from the model or background library.  
3. Click **Generate** again to create a new version.

Each regeneration counts as a new image and will deduct credits from your plan.
