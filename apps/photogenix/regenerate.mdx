<Info>
Use **Regenerate** when you want a fresh variation of an existing render â€” perfect for trying new models, environments, or lighting directions.
</Info>

1. Click **Regenerate** on your image.  
2. Update your selections from the model or background library.  
3. Click **Generate** again to create a new version.

<Note>
Each regeneration counts as a new image and will deduct credits from your plan.
