<Info>
Crafting the right prompt makes all the difference — here’s how to get consistent, brand-ready retouching.
</Info>

<Tip>
Use natural language — no technical syntax or weightings required.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Be visually descriptive: mention colors, materials, lighting, and placement.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Keep prompts under **150 words** for the best generation speed and quality.
</Tip>

<Tip>
Focus on what you want — avoid negative phrasing like “no background.” Instead, specify “plain white background.”
</Tip>

<Tip>
Tweak one element at a time if results look off — prompt refinement is part of the creative process.
</Tip>

<Note>
Prompting is an art form. The more you experiment, the more the AI adapts to your visual style.
