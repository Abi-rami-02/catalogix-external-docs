## Catalogix at a Glance

Catalogix lives inside the Streamoid CXO workspace, so the same credentials you use for Artifax and Photogenix unlock this environment too. From the dashboard you can launch every module â€” **Stores**, **Batches**, **Listings**, **AI Training**, and **Insights** â€” to manage product data from ingest to distribution.
