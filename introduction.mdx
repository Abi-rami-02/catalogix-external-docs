<Callout type="success" title="Your creative ecosystem, powered by AI">
  The **Streamoid CXO Suite** connects design ([Artifax](/apps/artifax/getting-started-with-artifax)), imagery ([Photogenix](/apps/photogenix/getting-started-with-photogenix)), and catalog operations ([Catalogix](/apps/catalogix/getting-started-with-catalogix)) in one workspace — so you can ship collections faster, with consistent quality across every channel.

## Why teams choose the CXO Suite

- **Unified workflows** — move from design to photography to listings without switching contexts.  
- **AI at every stage** — ideate, generate images, and enrich product data automatically.  
- **Collaboration-first** — creative and Catalog ops work in one shared workspace.  
- **Consistent quality** — taxonomy-driven content + on-brand visuals across channels.

## Kickstart your workspace

1. **Sign up or log in** at [app.streamoid.com/login](https://app.streamoid.com/login).  
2. **Create your workspace** and invite teammates.  
3. **Open an app** ([Artifax](/apps/artifax/getting-started-with-artifax), [Photogenix](/apps/photogenix/getting-started-with-photogenix), or [Catalogix](/apps/catalogix/getting-started-with-catalogix)) from the CXO dashboard.  
4. **Ship your first flow** — concept → imagery → listing.

<Callout type="warning" title="Pro tip for first-time setup">
  Start with a small sample set (10–20 products). Test your end-to-end flow, then scale with imports, automations, and exports.
