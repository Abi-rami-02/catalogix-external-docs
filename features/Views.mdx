## Data Highlights

The data highlights feature is used to highlight the data in the store. This highlighting follows a specific color coding. The data highlight section has various functionalities.

Let us understand them:

- **Data Gaps**

    Marks value present in the product image(**incoming from automations**) but not present in the feed(**data input file**). It will not show any legend if the image classifier has not run, or feed value is present.

    Legends

    - *Green* denotes classifier has high confidence.
    - *Orange* denotes classifier has medium confidence.
    - *Red* denotes classifier has low confidence.
    - *Black* denotes the no confidence score is available.
- **Data Errors**

    Marks values where image automation differ from the feed value. It shows the legends only if the feed value is present.

    The precedence of values appearing on the PLP is:

    **User > Feed > Automation**

    **Note**: Active value can be a user value or feed value.

    **Utility:** To check for values that have been wrongly predicted by the classifiers.

    Legends

    - *Green* denotes that active value and automation value are same (with high confidence).
    - *Orange* denotes that active value and automation value are same (with medium confidence).
    - *Red* denotes that active value and automation value are same (with low confidence) or **they are different.**
    - *Black* denotes the no confidence score is available.

- **Data Corrections**

    Marks values **changed by the user** from those **originally coming from the feed or automations.**

    **Utility:** To check status of values after they have been curated and reviewed by the user.

    **Legends**

    - *Green* denotes that user and automation values are same
    - *Orange* denotes that user and automation value are different.
    - *Red* denotes that feed and automation value are same, but the user has put a different value.
    - *Black* denotes the no confidence score is available (no automation value is there).

    **Duplicates**

    This feature helps the users in tracking the duplicates/redundancy in data.

    **Legends**

    - *Green* denotes that the data is more than 95% unique
    - *Orange* denotes that the data is between (65-95)% unique.
    - *Red* denotes that the data is less than 65% unique i.e. highly repetitive .
    - *Black* denotes the no confidence score is available (no automation value is there).

- **Character Count**

    This feature helps the user track character count of free text fields i.e. fields that do not a fixed set of values to choose from and have long form content. eg. Product name, product description.

    ![The red box indicates the location where the character count appears.](https://assets.catalogix.ai/6ccd1b1a4d894364ac0080638203fee2)
