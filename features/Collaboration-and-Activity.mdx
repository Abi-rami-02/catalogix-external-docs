## Sync Changes

If some major changes are done on the store, like product upload, bulk edit, etc by one of the team members. Then, the changes need to be synced on all the other membersâ€™ pages. In this case, a **sync your changes** pop-up would appear that would allow you to sync all changes to make the information in the stores uniform.
